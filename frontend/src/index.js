// ----------------> HEY, READ FROM HERE FOR UNDERSTANDING THE STATE PROVIDERS ABOVE:
// YOU CAN USE THESE STATE PROVIDERS IN ANY COMPONENT YOU WANT. BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT EVERY TIME SOMETHING CHANGES IN THESE STATES THE COMPONENTS THAT USES THESE STATES WILL BE RERENDERED!

// THIS MEANS TRY TO USE LESS THEM TO NOT SLOW DOWN THE APP BY RERENDERING ALL COMPONENTS FOR A SMALL CHANGE IN STATES.

// I LEFT YOU SOME COMMENT IN longState and shortState hook files to avoid from having very global providers to have specific component supplying providers. find hooks folder...
